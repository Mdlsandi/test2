      <p>I matriculated at Tetlanyo Secondary School in 2013. Then in 2015, I found out about a new course called Data Science,
        I was immediately interested and apply for the course at Sol Plaatje University which is based in Kimberley. I got accepted
        for the 3 year course, I was so happy because it required learners who studied Maths  and Science in high school. In 2017,
        I completed the course and graduated in record time. I then looked for a job  to get some practical experience to enhance my
        knowledge of theoretical concepts I learned in varsity, I got an internship at Department of Education. Currently, I am pursuing
        my Honours in Data Science and also working as an intern at Vodacom. So far, it's been a exciting journey without of learning
        opportunities.</p>
